## Introduction
A telepresence robotics vision system with low latency has been developed through 360-degree panoramic video. To overcome the latency issue in real time transmission of 360-degree panoramic video, a low latency transmission method has been proposed, which involves lowering the resolution for transmission and then restoring it through a super resolution network. In this project, the code is primarily divided into four main sections.

### Section 1: Latency Measurement
This section primarily contains the code proposed for latency measurement in a virtual environment. For more detailed information, please navigate to the 'LatencyMeasurement' folder.
